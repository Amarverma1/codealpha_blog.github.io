                Kerala is a state on the Malabar Coast of
                India. It was formed on 1 November 1956, following the passage of the States Reorganisation Act, by
                combining Malayalam-speaking regions of the erstwhile regions of Cochin, Malabar, South Canara, and
                Travancore. Spread over 38,863 km2 (15,005 sq mi), Kerala is the 21st largest Indian state by
                area. It is bordered by Karnataka to the north and northeast, Tamil Nadu to the east and south, and the
                Lakshadweep Sea[18] to the west. With 33 million inhabitants as per the 2011 census, Kerala is the
                13th-largest Indian state by population. It is divided into 14 districts with the capital being
                Thiruvananthapuram. Malayalam is the most widely spoken language and is also the official language of
                the state.

                Kerala has the lowest positive population growth rate in India, 3.44%; the highest Human Development
                Index (HDI), 0.784 in 2018 (0.712 in 2015); the highest literacy rate, 96.2% in the 2018 literacy survey
                conducted by the National Statistical Office, India;[10] the highest life expectancy, 77.3 years; and
                the highest sex ratio, 1,084 women per 1,000 men. Kerala is the least impoverished state in India
                according to NITI Aayog's Sustainable Development Goals dashboard and Reserve Bank of India's 'Handbook
                of Statistics on Indian Economy'.[20][21] Kerala is the second-most urbanised major state in the country
                with 47.7% urban population according to the 2011 Census of India. The state topped in the country
                to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals according to the annual report of NITI Aayog published in
                2019. The state has the highest media exposure in India with newspapers publishing in nine
                languages, mainly Malayalam and sometimes English. Hinduism is practised by more than half of the
                population, followed by Islam and Christianity.

            <h2>History</h2>
            <p>
                According to the Sangam classic Purananuru, the Chera king Senkuttuvan conquered the lands between
                Kanyakumari and the Himalayas.[43] Lacking worthy enemies, he besieged the sea by throwing his spear
                into it.[43][44] According to the 17th-century Hindu mythology work Keralolpathi, the lands of Kerala
                were recovered from the sea by the axe-wielding warrior sage Parasurama, the sixth avatar of Vishnu
                (hence, Kerala is also called Parasurama Kshetram 'The Land of Parasurama' in Hindu mythology).[45]
                Parasurama threw his axe across the sea, and the water receded as far as it reached. According to the
                legendary account, this new area of land extended from Gokarna to Kanyakumari.[46] The land which rose
                from sea was filled with salt and unsuitable for habitation; so Parasurama invoked the Snake King
                Vasuki, who spat holy poison and converted the soil into fertile lush green land. Out of respect, Vasuki
                and all snakes were appointed as protectors and guardians of the land. P. T. Srinivasa Iyengar
                theorised, that Senguttuvan may have been inspired by the Parasurama legendary account, which was
                brought by early Aryan settlers.[47]

            <h3>Geography</h3>
            <p>
                The state is wedged between the Lakshadweep Sea and the Western Ghats. Lying between northern latitudes
                8°18' and 12°48' and eastern longitudes 74°52' and 77°22',[203] Kerala experiences humid tropical
                rainforest climate with some cyclones. The state has a coast of 590 km (370 mi)[204] and the width of
                the state varies between 11 and 121 kilometres (7 and 75 mi).[205] Geographically, Kerala can be divided
                into three climatically distinct regions: the eastern highlands; rugged and cool mountainous terrain,
                the central mid-lands; rolling hills, and the western lowlands; coastal plains.[86]: 110  Pre-Cambrian
                and Pleistocene geological formations compose the bulk of Kerala's terrain.[206][207] A catastrophic
                flood in Kerala in 1341 CE drastically modified its terrain and consequently affected its history; it
                also created a natural harbour for spice transport.[208] The eastern region of Kerala consists of high
                mountains, gorges and deep-cut valleys immediately west of the Western Ghats' rain shadow.[86]: 110  41
                of Kerala's west-flowing rivers,[209] and 3 of its east-flowing ones originate in this region.[210][211]
                The Western Ghats form a wall of mountains interrupted only near Palakkad; hence also known Palghat,
                where the Palakkad Gap breaks.[212] The Western Ghats rise on average to 1,500 metres (4,900 feet) above
                sea level,[213] while the highest peaks reach around 2,500 metres (8,200 feet).[214] Anamudi in the
                Idukki district is the highest peak in south India, is at an elevation of 2,695 m (8,842 ft).[215] The
                Western Ghats mountain chain is recognised as one of the world's eight "hottest hotspots" of biological
                diversity and is listed among UNESCO World Heritage Sites.[216] The chain's forests are considered to be
                older than the Himalaya mountains.[216] The Athirappilly Falls, which is situated on the background of
                Western Ghat mountain ranges, is also known as The Niagara of India.[217] It is located in the Chalakudy
                River and is the largest waterfall in the state.[217] Wayanad is the sole Plateau in Kerala.[218] The
                eastern regions in the districts of Wayanad, Malappuram (Chaliyar valley at Nilambur), and Palakkad
                (Attappadi Valley), which together form parts of the Nilgiri Biosphere Reserve and a continuation of the
                Mysore Plateau, are known for natural Gold fields, along with the adjoining districts of Karnataka.[219]
