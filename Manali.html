                Manali is a town, near Kullu town in Kullu district in the Indian state
                of Himachal Pradesh. It is situated in the northern end of the Kullu
                Valley, formed by the Beas River. The town is located in the Kullu district,
                approximately 270 kilometres (170 mi) north of the state capital of Shimla and 544
                kilometres (338 mi) northeast of the national capital of New Delhi. With a
                population of 8,096 people recorded in the 2011 Indian census Manali is the
                beginning of an ancient trade route through Lahaul (H.P) and Ladakh, over
                the Karakoram Pass and onto Yarkand and Hotan in the Tarim Basin of China. Manali
                is a popular tourist destination in India and serves as the gateway to the Lahaul
                and Spiti district as well as the city of Leh in Ladakh.

                Manali is named after the Sanātanī lawgiver Manu (see Manusmriti). The name Manali is regarded as the
                derivative of Manu-Alaya. In Hindu cosmology, Manu is believed to have
                stepped off his ark in Manali to recreate human life after a great flood had deluged the world. The
                Kullu Valley in which Manali is situated is often referred to as the "Valley of the Gods". An old
                village in the town has an ancient temple dedicated to the sage Manu.

                Environmental concerns
                Manali has witnessed a flurry of activity related to hydroelectric power and tourism. Unplanned and
                rampant construction has led to severe depletion of forests and pollution of river bodies, along with
                garbage being disposed of on the side of the mountains. There has been a loss of habitat to various
                species of fauna, not limited to the Himalayan monal, incidentally the state bird of Uttarakhand.[10]
