        I started with the cheesiest one, but it’s absolutely true. Hear me out. I have a formal education from a fancy
        school. My degrees looked really nice hanging on the wall. I worked for years as a legal adviser and a
        University professor. I still work on research on my field. So I know it sounds odd, coming from me, that
        traveling can teach you more than school. But I truly believe it.

        When you experience a different culture, your mind opens. Learning about history and traditions makes you
        appreciate the differences, but mostly, it makes you see that all humans are fundamentally the same, no matter
        where you grew up, which religion you believe in (or don’t believe), or which language you speak.

        That’s why I don’t like borders. They’re one of the most hurtful things mankind ever created. They force us to
        see at other humans as ‘them’ and not ‘us’. They accentuate difference that don’t really exist. Different
        cultures don’t need an imaginary line in a map to thrive. In most cases, actually, these lines have hurt much
        more than helped. Different ethnicities thrown together for no reason, or the same tribe cut in half.

        The imaginary lines the West drew in the map of the Middle East are a main reason for the permanent crisis of
        the region. Same goes for Northern Africa. Have you ever seen how perfect the lines are? A straight line going
        from north to south or from east to west, without caring about what is there in real life. Without looking at
        what nature has to say. With one ruler over everything and everyone that happened to be within the drawing, even
        if there’s no legitimate representation. Different religions and faiths under a government that only upholds
        one. People forced to leave their ancestors’ land to join their family on the other side of the line.

      <h2>Traveling is the best way of learning</h2>
      <p>
        You can be an expert on theory of Human Rights, but you will understand the real significance of the concept
        when you go around the world meeting people. Then the cause becomes more personal than it could have ever been
        before. This is the case for me. I’ve worked on Human Rights from the moment I graduated Law School, but it
        wasn’t until I saw some of the realities I’ve read about that it hit me. We need to change mentalities for the
        world to be a better place, we need to leave our selfishness behind.

        What you’ll learn better on the road than in any classroom is to understand your own background. There’re
        countries where you grow up hearing that there’s no place on earth that could be better. In others you might
        hear that everywhere else is better. The truth is probably in the middle. You’ll appreciate the wonders of your
        country more when I see others, and you’ll be more critical on the things that can be improve through other
        examples
