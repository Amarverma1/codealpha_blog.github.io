                India’s official ‘pink city’, there’s much more to Rajasthan’s capital than its pink-red-tinged
                buildings and historic splendour. This majestic home to erstwhile royals is complete with old-world
                charm surrounded by colorful markets and chaotic streets. A part of the ‘Golden Triangle, Jaipur is a
                must-visit destination along with Agra and New Delhi.

                About 6 hours away from New Delhi, grand palaces and haveli is surrounded by mighty fortresses make
                Jaipur a welcome respite from high-rise malls and urban living. Blue pottery and more, take time off to
                watch a potter at work. Look out for the odd camel strolling through Jaipur’s busy streets as you make
                your way past hawkers and cycle rickshaws against a backdrop of its vibrant terracotta edifices.
                Stopover for the cultural show at Chowki Dhani before you head on to the world’s largest sundial at
                Jantar Mantar, Amer Fort, and the Palace of Winds, Hawa Mahal, overlooking Johari Bazaar. If you’re
                lucky enough to be untravelling Jaipur during Holi (in March), watch spectacularly bedecked elephants in
                action at elephant-polo. Then again, October in Jaipur has its own share of fun with the donkey festival
                and ‘best-looking donkey’ award as well as donkey racing and trading.

            <h2>History</h2>
            <p>
                The city of Jaipur was founded by the King of Amber, Maharaja Sawai Jai Singh II on 18 November 1727,
                who ruled from 1699 to 1743. He planned to shift his capital from Amber, 11 kilometres (7 mi) to Jaipur
                to accommodate the growing population and increasing scarcity of water. Jai Singh consulted several
                books on architecture and architects while planning the layout of Jaipur. Under the architectural
                guidance of Vidyadhar Bhattacharya, Jaipur was planned based on the principles of Vastu Shastra and
                Shilpa Shastra.[16] The construction of the city began in 1726 and took four years to complete the major
                roads, offices, and palaces. The architecture of the city was heavily influenced by the 17th century
                architectural renaissance during Mughal rule in Northern India. Hence much of it resembles architecture
                styles from around the Muslim world. The city was divided into nine blocks, two of which contained the
                state buildings and palaces, with the remaining seven allotted to the public. Huge ramparts were built,
                pierced by seven fortified

            <p>
                Jaipur has many cultural sites like Jawahar Kala Kendra formed by Architect Charles Correa and Ravindra
                Manch. Government Central Museum hosts several arts and antiquities. There is a government museum at
                Hawa Mahal and an art gallery at Viratnagar. There are statues depicting Rajasthani culture around the
                city.[78][79] Jaipur has many traditional shops selling antiques and handicrafts, as well as
                contemporary brands reviving traditional techniques, such as Anokhi. The prior rulers of Jaipur
                patronised a number of arts and crafts. They invited skilled artisans, artists and craftsmen from India
                and abroad who settled in the city. Some of the crafts include bandhani, block printing, stone carving
                and sculpture, tarkashi, zari, gota-patti, kinari and zardozi, silver jewellery, gems, kundan, meenakari

                leather ware.[80][75]

                Jaipur has its own performing arts. The Jaipur Gharana for Kathak is one of the three gharanas of the
                major north Indian classical dance form of Kathak.[81] The Jaipur Gharana of Kathak is known for its
                rapid intricate dance forms, vivacious body movements and subtle Abhinaya.[81] The Ghoomar is a popular
                folk dance style.[82][83][84] Tamasha is an art form where Kathputli puppet dance is shown in play
                form.[39] Major festivals celebrated in Jaipur include Elephant Festival, Gangaur, Makar Sankranti,
                Holi, Diwali, Vijayadashami, Teej, Eid, Mahavir Jayanti and Christmas. Jaipur is also famous for the
                Jaipur Literature Festival, the world's largest free literature festival in which authors, writers and
